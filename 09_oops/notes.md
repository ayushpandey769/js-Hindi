## 4 pillars
Abstraction (Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user.)

Encapsulation (Protects object integrity by preventing external code from directly modifying internal object state unintentionally or improperly. It enforces controlled access through getter/setter methods or access modifiers (private, protected, public))

Inheritance (Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a new class (called a subclass or child class) is created based on an existing class (called a superclass or parent class). )

Polymorphism (we can use different methods to do same work)
